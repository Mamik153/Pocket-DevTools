# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently in early development. Security fixes are applied to the latest code on the default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these private channels instead:

- GitHub private vulnerability reporting (if enabled for this repository)
- Direct private contact with repository maintainers

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Affected endpoints, files, or components
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Response Expectations

Maintainers will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and work on a fix based on severity and exploitability.

After a fix is available, maintainers may publish a coordinated disclosure with remediation guidance.
